What is ElastixFromMatlab?
==========================

elastix (http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/)is a library and a set of open source command 
line programs for rigid and nonrigid registration of images. elastix is based on the
Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK, http://www.itk.org).

ElastixFromMatlab is a Matlab (http://www.mathworks.com) wrapper around elastix. 
With ElastixFromMatlab you can interactively and efficiently register your images
with elastix from Matlab.

ElastixFromMatlab was released under CeCILL-B free software license.
The text of the license is available in English and in French in the files COPYING.txt
and COPYING-FR.txt.

How to install it
=================

  - You must have Matlab installed on your computer.
